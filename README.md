## üîî Information
Check if this version matches with your version of WhatsApp. The mod **won't**  work if the version doesn't match!

‚ö† **This tool won't work with the Microsoft Store or App Store version of WhatsApp Desktop. Please use instead the direct downloaded version linked [here](https://www.whatsapp.com/download/).**

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Disclaimer
> This is not an official WhatsApp Desktop Dark Mode. I won't be responsible for any damage you've done yourself trying to install this mod. The code for the Injector and the patched files has full transparency since I've made it open-source right here.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Removal
Make sure you have [WhatsApp Desktop](https://www.whatsapp.com/download/) installed on your PC or Mac first.
Simply start the executable and select `Install WADark`. 

Simply reinstall WhatsApp Desktop, if you want to remove WADark.

## üñåÔ∏è Themes
WADark can apply custom themes to WhatsApp. I include ```2``` different Themes in WADark ([Here is a list of all available themes](https://github.com/valnoxy/wadark/blob/main/THEMES.md)). Simply click on "Install with WADark" to apply the theme.

You can also create your own theme! Just clone the ```theme.json``` file and move it to the same directory as WADark. The option ```Local theme``` will appear while patching WhatsApp Desktop (only CLI).

```NEW!``` You can create your own theme with the URL Protocol!
The URL Protocol is build as following:

```
wadark://valnoxy/myCustomTheme?themedata=%7B%22bgcol%22%3A%22...
            |           |                          |
          Author   Theme Name             encoded JSON in URL
```

I personally use [this site](https://codebeautify.org/json-url-encode) for encoding JSON.

If you want to make your theme available for everyone, submit your theme [here](https://forms.gle/9jsrjFUaE78AeYfGA) or via E-Mail to ```hey@exploitox.de```. After a short review, I will include your theme in the next WADark update!
